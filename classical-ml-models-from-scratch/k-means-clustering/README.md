goal: cluster dataset into k different clusters. unsupervised learning.

iterative optimization
1. initialize cluster centers (for example, randomly)
2. repeat until converged:
    - update cluster labels
    - update cluster centers (centroid): set to mean of each cluster

euclidean distance
get the distance between two feature vectors
d(p,q) = sqrt(sum(pi-qi)^2)
