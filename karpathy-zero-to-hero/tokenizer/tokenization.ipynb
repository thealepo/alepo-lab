    "In November 2025, Topuria announced that he would not be competing in the first quarter of 2026 due to personal reasons.[68]\n",
    "\n",
    "Fighting style and training\n",
    "Initially coming into the UFC organization with a strong base in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, Topuria dedicated himself to enhancing his stand-up game, developing a boxing-heavy approach under the guidance of experienced coaches. His boxing style is marked by precise shot selection, fluid combinations, and remarkable power, which was on full display during his knockout victories over Alexander Volkanovski, Max Holloway, and Charles Oliveira. Topuria's execution of boxing is strategic, using his footwork and positioning to set up clean, fight-altering punches.[69][70] Topuria is also known for his defensive techniques such as his use of the shoulder roll against Josh Emmett.[71][72] He has cited the Mexican boxing style, particularly that of Canelo Álvarez, as a major inspiration for his striking, adapting its principles to mixed martial arts.[73]\n",
    "\n",
    "Topuria has trained with fellow Georgian and UFC Bantamweight Champion Merab Dvalishvili, who has praised Topuria's grappling skills, stating that he has \"great wrestling, great jiu-jitsu,\". Dvalishvili also brought up Topuria's striking power, stating that he \"hits hard\" and Topuria had dropped him twice with body shots in sparring sessions.[74]\n",
    "\n",
    "Personal life\n",
    "\n",
    "Topuria accepting an award from the President of Georgia at the Orbeliani Palace\n",
    "Topuria is fluent in Georgian, English, Spanish, and also speaks a bit of Mingrelian.[75][76][77] Topuria has a son (born 2019) and daughter (born 2024) from his current wife, Giorgina Uzcategui Badell.[78][79][80]\n",
    "\n",
    "Topuria is a Christian.[81][82][83]\n",
    "\n",
    "Topuria's older brother Aleksandre, also a mixed martial artist, debuted with the UFC in February 2025 at UFC 312.[84]\n",
    "\n",
    "On March 5, 2024, Topuria obtained Spanish citizenship after it was announced at the Council of Ministers press conference.[3][85]\n",
    "\n",
    "On March 21, 2024, Topuria was awarded the Order of Honor by the President of Georgia in Orbeliani Palace, Tbilisi, Georgia.[86] That day, Georgian Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze announced that the government will ensure Ilia retains his Georgian citizenship, making him a dual citizen of Georgia and Spain.[2]\n",
