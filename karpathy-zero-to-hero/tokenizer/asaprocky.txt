In August 2011, Mayers' single "Peso" was leaked online and began receiving radio airplay within weeks, propelling cloud rap into mainstream attention.[11][12] He signed with Polo Grounds Music, an imprint of RCA Records in October of that year, and released his debut mixtape, Live. Love. A$AP (2011), in October of that year to widespread critical acclaim.[13][14]

Mayers' 2012 single, "Fuckin' Problems" (featuring Drake, 2 Chainz and Kendrick Lamar), marked his first entry—at number eight—on the Billboard Hot 100, was nominated for Best Rap Song at the 56th Annual Grammy Awards, and preceded his debut studio album, Long. Live. A$AP (2013). A critical and commercial success, it debuted atop the Billboard 200 and received double platinum certification by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). His second album, At. Long. Last. A$AP (2015), also debuted atop the chart and saw continued critical praise; its two lead singles, "Lord Pretty Flacko Jodye 2 (LPFJ2)" and "Everyday" (featuring Rod Stewart, Miguel and Mark Ronson), both received double platinum certifications by the RIAA, while its third, "L$D", was nominated for Best Music Video at the 58th Annual Grammy Awards. His third album, Testing (2018), debuted within the Billboard 200's top five, while his fourth album, Don't Be Dumb, is scheduled for release in January 16, 2026.[15][16][17]

Early life
Rakim Athelston Mayers was born on October 3, 1988, in the Harlem neighborhood of Manhattan, a borough of New York City.[26][27] His father, Adrian "Duke" Athelston Mayers, was from Barbados and his mother, Rina "Renee" Black, is of African American and part Guyanese descent.[28][29] The couple raised four children together; Ricky, Erika B., Rakim and Asia.[30][31] Both Rakim and Erika's names are taken from the Eric B. & Rakim duo.[32] Mayers has 10 other paternal siblings. His cousin is fellow ASAP Mob member ASAP Nast.[33]

Mayers started rapping at age nine, when he moved to Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.[34] He learned how to rap from his older brother, who also wore the cornrows hairdo that Mayers later adopted. When Mayers was 13, his brother Ricky was killed by gun violence in Harlem.[35] The death inspired Mayers to take rapping more seriously.[36] Mayers grew up admiring Harlem-based rap group the Diplomats. He was also influenced by Mobb Deep,[37] Three 6 Mafia, UGK, Run DMC, Wu-Tang Clan, and Bone Thugs-n-Harmony.[38]

When Mayers was 12 years old, his father went to jail and he spent his teenage years moving around homeless shelters with his mother and sister.[39] After living for a period in a shelter with his mother in New York City, he moved to Midtown Manhattan.[30] His father died in 2012.[40]

Career
2007–2011: Career beginnings
In 2007, Mayers joined the A$AP Mob crew, a Harlem-based collective of rappers, producers, music video directors, fashion designers, and bikers who shared similar interests in music, fashion, style, and art.[41] It had been formed by A$AP Yams, A$AP Bari and A$AP Illz.[42][43] In July 2011, Mayers released his single "Purple Swag" which quickly became a street anthem in New York City.[44][45][46]

In August 2011, Mayers’ single "Peso", was leaked online and within weeks received airplay on the high-profile Hot 97 New York radio station.[11] After he released a music video for his song "Purple Swag", he received attention from several record labels. In October, he released the mixtape Live. Love. A$AP to critical acclaim. Earlier that month, he signed a two-year, $3 million record deal with Bryan Leach's Polo Grounds Music, which at the time was distributed by Clive Davis' Sony Music division of J Records.[47] Upon his record deal, Mayers started a label, A$AP Worldwide, with A$AP Yams.[42] However, Mayers’ deal with J Records would be short-lived,[citation needed] when on October 7, RCA Music Group announced that it was merging J alongside Arista and Jive Records into RCA Records.[13] With the shutdown, Mayers (and all other artists previously signed to these three labels) will release future material under the RCA brand.[48] On December 5, he was nominated for BBC's Sound of 2012 poll.[49]

2012–2014: Touring and Long. Live. A$AP

Mayers performing at the 2012 Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival
In February 2012, Mayers joined Kendrick Lamar as the opening act for Drake's Club Paradise Tour.[50] In June, SpaceGhostPurrp, founder of Miami-based collective Raider Klan and Mayers’ past collaborator, accused A$AP Twelvyy of jumping Raider Klan's Matt Stoops and subsequently disassociated himself from A$AP Mob and Mayers in a YouTube video.[51] He and Raider Klan also accused ASAP Mob of copying their style,[51] and Mayers of using lyrics from SpaceGhostPurrp's song "My Enemy" on "Goldie".[52] Mayers responded in a July interview for MTV, saying that SpaceGhostPurrp is "try[ing] to build hype" and told him to "stick to makin' beats".[51]

In July 2012, Mayers performed at the Pitchfork Music Festival.[53] He was scheduled to make his network television debut on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon on July 20,[53] but he was then arrested the night before, after an alleged involvement in a brawl, with 21-year-old artist iRome. The scuffle took place in downtown Manhattan and the performance was canceled.[54][55] After it was rescheduled for August 21, Mayers performed "Goldie" on the show.[56] On September 6, he also performed a guest rap on Rihanna's "Cockiness (Love It)" at the 2012 MTV Video Music Awards.[57]

Mayers recorded his debut studio album Long. Live. A$AP, along with several producers, such as Clams Casino, Hit-Boy, Friendzone, A$AP Ty Beats, Soufein3000 and Joey Fat Beats.[58] "Goldie" was released as the album's first single on April 27.[59] On August 27, his crew A$AP Mob released the mixtape Lords Never Worry as a free download.[60] During September through November, Mayers promoted the album with the 40-date national concert tour, the Long Live ASAP Tour, with opening acts ScHoolboy Q, Danny Brown, and A$AP Mob.[61] Long. Live. A$AP was released on January 15, 2013, to mostly positive reviews from critics.[62] The album debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, with first-week sales of 139,000 copies in the United States.[63] As of March 13, 2013, it has sold 284,000 copies.[64] On March 16, 2015, Long. Live. A$AP was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), for the shipment of 500,000 copies in the United States.[65][66]

On April 12, 2013, in an interview at Wild 94.9 radio station, Mayers revealed that he was working on an instrumental album, which he plans on releasing without notice. He also discussed his favorite music videos and talked about his desire to collaborate with veteran rapper André 3000.[67] On June 21, Mayers told MTV News that he had completed his debut instrumental album, which mostly consists of ambient oriented instrumental tracks, titled Beauty & The Beast: Slowed Down Sessions (Chapter 1) and was originally set to be released during the summer for free download.[68] However, that album was delayed with no release date announced. Mayers previewed two snippets that would have made the Beauty & The Beast: Slowed Down Sessions (Chapter 1) compilation, titled "Riot Rave" and "Unicorn".[69] The project has not been released as of 2025.[citation needed]

2015–2017: At. Long. Last. A$AP

Mayers in 2013
On March 16, 2014, Mayers announced that he was working on his second studio album, entitled A.L.L.A. (an acronym for At. Long. Last. A$AP)[70] which was a follow-up to his debut album, Long. Live. A$AP.[71] Upon the wake of a delay of the ASAP Mob album, L.O.R.D., Mayers subsequently collaborated with cohorts A$AP Ferg, Nast and Twelvyy on the album's third single, "Hella Hoes", which was released on June 6, 2014.[72] Nonetheless, A$AP Mob leader A$AP Yams announced on his Tumblr account that the album had been shelved.[73] On October 3, 2014, his 26th birthday, Mayers launched a short-lived music giveaway called Flacko Jodye Season,[74] which first premiered with "Multiply", which featured additional vocals from Juicy J;[75][76] later released on iTunes one week after its premiere.[77][78]

On New Year's Day 2015, Mayers released his second album's lead single, "Lord Pretty Flacko Jodye 2 (LPFJ2)", a sequel to "Pretty Flacko".[79] Then, on January 18, seventeen days after the single's release, Mayers’ mentor and partner, Steven "A$AP Yams" Rodriguez, died at the age of 26.[80][81] However, some reports later stated that Yams' cause was ruled acute mixed drug intoxication[82] while Mayers and several A$AP Mob members and affiliates said that the late leader of the collective died due to his sleep apnea, which caused asphyxiation and pulmonary aspiration.[83][84][85] Weeks after Yams' death, Mayers revealed that At. Long. Last. A$AP was executive-produced by rapper Juicy J, producer Danger Mouse, Mayers and Yams themselves.[86][87][88]

In 2015, Mayers appeared in a cameo role in the indie comedy-drama, Dope. The film premiered at the 2015 Sundance Film Festival on January 21, 2015.[89] It opened in all movie theaters on June 12.[90] There at the event, Mayers explained his expressions and grief over the death of his own friend and partner; performed "Multiply" on-stage as a dedication to his loving memory, minutes before running backstage to calm down.[91] In March 2015, Mayers said in an interview with MTV News that he made songs such as "Wild For The Night" and "Fuckin' Problems" for mainstream commercial success, and that he now hated those songs.[92]

On April 8, 2015, the rapper released a song, titled "M'$", debuted during an interview with the Red Bull Music Academy, and was released on the iTunes Store two days later,[93] however, it was announced that the song was not an official single from the album.[94] The album, however, did include a remixed version of the track that replaced Mayers’ second verse with a guest verse from Lil Wayne. On May 9, Mayers unveiled the album's cover art on his official Instagram page, with the caption "AT LONG LAST...."[95] On the same day, he then released the album's alternative artwork[96] and released the album's second single, titled "Everyday" featuring Rod Stewart, Miguel and Mark Ronson (the latter of which also produced the track alongside Emile Haynie).[97][98] Mayers also announced that the release date for A.L.L.A. was updated to June 2, 2015; however, on May 25, 2015, around 6:00 PM EDT, the album leaked online, approximately one week before its expected release.[99] Subsequently, Mayers tweeted to announce that the album will be released at midnight (May 26), changing the date a week early.[100]

Upon its release, At. Long. Last. A$AP received generally positive to mixed reviews from music critics.[101] Overall, the album was supported by the release of three singles: "Lord Pretty Flacko Jodye 2 (LPFJ2)", "Everyday" and "L$D". At. Long. Last. A$AP debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, selling 116,000 copies in the United States.[102] In conclusion to this, it also gave Mayers his second consecutive number one album on the charts to date.[103] In Canada, the album debuted at number one, with 11,000 copies sold.[104] The album has spent two more weeks beyond the top ten of the Billboard 200.[105][106] As of July 2015, the album has sold 215,000 copies in the United States.[107] It has sold 60,662 copies in the United Kingdom, as of June 2015.[108]

I pray every day before I go to sleep."[151] He addresses these views in the song "Holy Ghost" on his 2015 album At. Long. Last. ASAP. During Mayers’ 2019 incarceration in Sweden, he prayed to keep himself occupied.[152]

Mayers is 5'11" (180 cm) tall, which he revealed in a Nikki & Sara Live interview to contextualize why he felt out-of-place standing next to the much taller Jason Collins.[153]

Graffiti about Mayers in Stockholm
In July 2019, Mayers was arrested initially for aggravated, then for simple assault in Stockholm, Sweden, after an altercation in the street against a man named Mustafa Jafari and another person that involved Mayers and three of his entourage on June 30.[168][169][170] Jafari was beaten, kicked, and cut with broken bottles when down on the ground.[171] He suffered several cuts, requiring stitches, and a fractured rib.[172] Mayers uploaded two videos of the incident to Instagram. In the first, he and his entourage repeatedly ask two young men, including Jafari, to stop following them as the latter complains about his headphones.[173] In the other, created from footage of assorted events, Jafari's headphones break during a scuffle, and he is seen hitting Mayers’ bodyguard with them. A woman is also seen in the video, accusing the two men of groping.[174][175] Henrik Olsson Lilja, the defense attorney for Mayers, maintained that his client acted in self-defense after being attacked by Jafari.[176]

Mayers’ bodyguard filed a counter-complaint against Jafari,[177] and Jafari was initially suspected of harassment and minor assault or possibly attempted assault.[178] The investigation against Jafari was dropped as prosecutors said he acted in self-defense, after being grabbed by the neck and pushed by the bodyguard.[179][180] Mayers was arrested after being allowed to finish his gig at Stadion.[181][182] As it was judged there was a risk that he may flee or tamper with evidence, he was kept in custody at Kronoberg Remand Prison until the trial,[183][184][185] with two members of his entourage also under arrest.[186] Mayers’ ongoing tour was then put on hiatus due to the trial.[187]

He was visited by personnel from the US embassy shortly after his arrest.[188] Several US artists called for a boycott of Sweden due to the incident.[189][190] A petition to release him was started.[191] The family asked Al Sharpton for help.[192] American President Donald Trump tweeted his support for Mayers, and it was later revealed by justice minister Morgan Johansson that Trump had threatened trade restrictions against Sweden if Mayers was not released.[193] Former US ambassador to Sweden Mark Brzezinski suggested that the government should intervene and speculated that racism may have been the cause of the brawl.[194] Foreign minister Margot Wallström said the government is not allowed to interfere citing Chapter 11 §3 of the Swedish constitutional Instrument of Government which explicitly forbids the interference of politicians, or unrelated government offices, in the work of the courts of law.[citation needed]

Mayers was convicted of assault, given a suspended prison sentence and asked to pay 12,500 kr ($1,270) in damages to the victim.[195] The court could not decide who used the bottle, but said it was not a case of self-defense.[196] As Mayers had already served over a month in jail for the incident before the sentence was handed out, it was determined that he did not need to serve any additional time.[197] The conviction does not bar him from returning to Sweden.[198]

Shooting in Hollywood
On April 20, 2022, Mayers was arrested by LAPD officers upon arriving to the Los Angeles International Airport after a vacation with his partner, Rihanna. He was arrested for a potential assault with a deadly weapon in a shooting that took place in Hollywood on November 6, 2021.[199][200] The shooting victim, who survived the incident with only a graze to his knuckle, was reported to be former friend and collaborator Terell Ephron, better known as ASAP Relli.[201][202] Bail was set at $550,000 and he was released shortly after.[200][199]

After his arrest, detectives executed a warrant to search his home, gaining entry by using a pry bar to force the gate open. Detectives took several boxes from his home to use as evidence.[203] Investigating officers did not find any shell casings at the scene and recovered no fingerprints from the 9mm casings Ephron later provided to police. The gun allegedly used was never found during a search of Mayers' residence. However, surveillance footage of the scene captured a man in a hooded sweatshirt, identified as the defendant, potentially holding a gun.[204] On August 15, 2022, the Los Angeles County District Attorney's office filed charges against Mayers.[205]

On November 20, 2023, a Los Angeles judge, M.L. Villar, determined that there was sufficient evidence for Mayers to stand trial after hearing roughly a day and a half of testimony from two witnesses during a preliminary court hearing.[206][201] On January 8, 2024, Mayers entered a plea of not guilty, turning down a plea bargain of six months in jail, and risking a maximum sentence of over 20 years in prison.[207][202] Mayers missed a hearing scheduled for March 6, 2024.[208][209] During a court hearing which took place on May 23, Mayers had his trial set to start on October 21.[210] The trial start date was pushed back to January 21, 2025.[211][212] In a departure from typical practices in LA County courts, the judge allowed cameras to record almost the entirety of the trial.[204] The defense team and witnesses stated that Mayers had used a prop gun that fired blanks.[202] Jurors were instructed that they could acquit Mayers if he fired in self-defense.[202] On February 18, Mayers was found not guilty.[213]
